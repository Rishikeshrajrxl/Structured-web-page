 <p>In computer security,a hacker is someone who focuses on security mechanisms of computer and network systems. While including those who endeavor tp strengthen such
mechanisms,it is more
   often used by the mass media and popular culture to refer to those who seek access despite these security measores.<br>
   According to <strong> White Devil</strong>a, cracker or cracking is to "gain unauthoeized access to a computer in order to commit another crime such as destroying information
 contained
   in that system". A Wihte hat hacker breaks security for non-malicious reasons, either to test their own security system,perform penetration tests, or vulnerability assessments for a
security company
   which makes security software.</p>

  <h1 id="para">What is the dark web? How to access it and what you'll find   </h1>

  <p>The dark web is part of the internet that isn't visible too search engines and requires the use of an anonymizing browser called Tor to be accessed. Dark web definition
The dark web is a part of the internet that isn't indexed by search engines. You've no doubt heard talk of the �dark web� as a hotbed of criminal activity � and it is. Researchers Daniel
Moore and
Thomas Rid of King's College in London classified the contents of 2,723 live dark web sites over a five-week period a couple of years ago and found that 57 percent host illicit material.
You can buy credit card numbers, all manner of drugs, guns, counterfeit money, stolen subscription credentials, hacked Netflix accounts and software that helps you break into other
 people�s computers.
Buy login credentials to a $50,000 Bank of America account for $500. Get $3,000 in counterfeit $20 bills for $600. Buy seven prepaid debit cards, each with a $2,500 balance, for $500
(express shipping included). A �lifetime� Netflix premium account goes for $6. You can hire hackers to attack computers for you. You can buy usernames and passwords.
But not everything is illegal, the dark web also has a legitimate side. For example, you can join a chess club or BlackBook, a social network described as the �the Facebook of Tor.�</p>

<p style="color:green"><i><b>Note:</b> This post contains links to dark web sites that can only be accessed with the Tor browser, which can be downloaded for free at https://www.torproject.org.</i></p>

<p>Still, for those willing to put up with the inconvenience, the dark web provides a memorable glimpse at the seamy underbelly of the human experience � without the risk of
 skulking around in a dark alley. </p>
<br><br>
<div id="section">
<h1 id="para">Is the dark web illegal?</h1>
<p>We don�t want to leave you with the impression that everything on the dark web is nefarious or illegal. The Tor network began as an anonymous communications channel, and it still serves a
 valuable purpose in helping people communicate in environments that are hostile to free speech. �A lot of people use it in countries where there�s eavesdropping or where internet access is
criminalized,� Tiquet said.
If you want to learn all about privacy protection or cryptocurrency, the dark web has plenty to offer. There are a variety of private and encrypted email services, instruction for  installing
 an anonymous operating system and advanced tips for the privacy-conscious.
There�s also material that you wouldn�t be surprised to find on the public web, such as links to full-text editions of hard-to-find books, collections of political news from mainstream
 websites and a guide to the steam tunnels under the Virginia Tech campus. You can conduct discussions about current events anonymously on Intel Exchange. There are several whistleblower
 sites, including a dark web version of Wikileaks. Pirate Bay, a BitTorrent site that law enforcement officials have repeatedly shut down, is alive and well there. Even Facebook has a dark
 web presence.
�More and more legitimate web companies are starting to have presences there,� Tiquet said. �It shows that they�re aware, they�re cutting edge and in the know.�
There�s also plenty of practical value for some organizations. Law enforcement agencies keep an ear to the ground on the dark web looking for stolen data from recent security breaches that
 might lead to a trail to the perpetrators. Many mainstream media organizations monitor whistleblower sites looking for news.</p>



<h1 id="para">Dark web sites</h1>

<p>Dark web sites look pretty much like any other site, but there are important differences. One is the naming structure. Instead of ending in .com or .co, dark web sites end in .onion.
That�s
�a special-use top level domain suffix designating an anonymous hidden service reachable via the Tor network,� according to Wikipedia. Browsers with the appropriate proxy can reach
these sites, but others can�t.
Dark web sites also use a scrambled naming structure that creates URLs that are often impossible to remember. For example, a popular commerce site called Dream Market goes by the
unintelligible address of �eajwlvm3z2lcca76.onion.�
Many dark websites are set up by scammers, who constantly move around to avoid the wrath of their victims. Even commerce sites that may have existed for a year or more can suddenly
disappear if the owners decide to cash in and flee with the escrow money they�re holding on behalf of customers.
Law enforcement officials are getting better at finding and prosecuting owners of sites that sell illicit goods and services. In the summer of 2017, a team of cyber cops from three
countries successfully shut down AlphaBay, the dark web�s largest source of contraband, sending shudders throughout the network. But many merchants simply migrated elsewhere.
The anonymous nature of the Tor network also makes it especially vulnerable to distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS), said Patrick Tiquet, Director of Security & Architecture
at Keeper Security, and the company�s resident expert on the topic. �Sites are constantly changing addresses to avoid DDoS, which makes for a very dynamic environment,� he said.
As a result, �The quality of search varies widely, and a lot of material is outdated.�</p>

<h1 style="color:red">Here are several benefits of the hidden web as follows:</h1>
<h4>1. Anonymity</h4>
<p style="color:green">Anonymity is the primary reason why many individuals are making their way towards the hidden network and opting for dark web browsers to surf the internet. <br>However, as much as anonymity aids in privacy,
 it also harbors criminal activities. It is the very reason why the reputation of the dark web is a bit spooky.</p>

<h4>2. Freedom of Speech</h4>
<P   style="color:green">Freedom of Speech is not universal, and most countries don�t consider it as a fundamental right of a citizen. While the United States and few other nations <br>encourage freedom of speech,
 it is a distant dream for the citizens of several countries worldwide. Deep web browsing helps the citizens of such nations <br>to hide their identity and allow them to express their opinion
freely. Deep web browsing also eliminates any censorship of the country, and everything is<br> accessible in the dark web without any restraint.</p>

</h4>3. Knowledge</h4>
<p  style="color:green">Deep web or hidden web is also an excellent platform for doctors, scientists, researchers, and teachers to share their data without any restriction or censorship.<br> You will find data
related to the scientific findings that most Governments want to hide or content redefining some health or social beliefs on the dark web. <br>Most importantly, you will find literature
works which are available in their purest form in this hidden web. Knowledge is best delivered when it is not filtered. <br>Dark web harbors all the literature works featuring different
thinking or opinions. You can access information on the deep web which is not available even at schools or colleges.</p>

<h4>4. Political Activism</h4>
<p   style="color:green">The deep web also aids leaders and political activists with their noble causes. In an oppressive Government structure, information is always manipulated and restricted. <br>The
 administration often keeps a watch on every citizen�s activities on the internet and hinders any spread of revolutionary thoughts. The deep web is the best platform for<br> people
 belonging to such nations with oppressive Government structure. The dark network offers a private and secure line of communication for the leaders to revolutionize<br> and educate
 people about their fundamental rights.
Most common internet browsers aren�t compatible to access the dark web. You need specialized deep web browsers <br>to access the hidden side of the World Wide Web.</P>
